How to run 'test_tvsbvar_simulation' to draw samples from the time varying structured Bayesain vector autoregression (tvsbvar)  model using the dsmh sampler.

1. The executable file 'test_tvsbvar_simulation' accepts the following command line options:

a. Simulation related options:
-F: directory to save samples, default is the current directory (where the exectuable file is)
-R: to specify the id of the simulation run, default is the time of running
-o: to turn on the pure Metropolis-Hasting, default is off
-H: number of stages, default is 1
-M: number of striations,  default is 1
-T: lambda_1, default is 0.1
-P: probability of equi-energy jump, default is 1/(10.0* thinning factor)
-I: thinning factor, default is 50
-N: number of draws per group, default is 200000
-B: burning-in length, default is 0
-G: number of groups, default is 1

b. Diagnosis related:
-j: to display the rate of equi-energy jump and the rate of MH jump, default is off
-t: to display the number of transitions across striations, default is off
-d: to display the distribution of the samples among striations, default is off
-m: to calculate and display log(marginal data density) using the Mueller's method, default is off but to only calculate and display log(marginal data density) using the importance reweighting method.

c. Model specific:
-D: data file that must be provided, e.g., ../share/3var_13lag_half_data.txt
-V: file specifying Markovian regime switching process, e.g., ../share/tvsbvar/restriction_rp_3var_13lag_v2stoch_c2stoch.txt for (one base regime), two multiplicative regimes and two additive regimes, or ../share/tvsbvar/restriction_rp_3var_13lag_v2stoch.txt for (one base regime), two multiplicative regimes (and one additive regime). Either -V or -C must be provided
-C: file specifying deterministic regime switching process. The number of rows in this file should be the same as the number of observations, one row per observation. The number of columsn in this file should be at least two, with the first column specifying the regime index (>=1 and <= number of regimes) for the multiplicative part, nad the second column specifying the regime index (>=1 and <= number of regimes) for the additive part. Either -V or -C must be provided
-S: model restriction file that must be provided, e.g., ../share/tvsbvar/restriction_tvsbvar_3var_13lag_v2_c2.txtfor the model with (one base,) two multiplicative and two additive regimes, or ../share/tvsbvar/restriction_tvsbvar_3var_13lag_v2.txt for the model with (one base,) two multiplicative (and one additive regime). Here the multiple regimes can either be Markovian or deterministic
-Y: file must be provided to specify the values of hyper parameters, e.g., ../share/tvsbvar/restriction_hyper_constant.txt when hyper-parameters are deterministic, or ../share/tvsbvar/restriction_hyper_variable.txt when some parameters are deterministic while others are from some probability distribution 

2. Data file
The data file is a text file containing the time series data that are used to estimate the parameters of the model. Each row corresponds to the observation at one time point. Each column corresponds to one dimension of the data; and in particular the first column corresponds to the time points.

3. Restriction files
See ../share/tvsbvar/*.txt for how the restriction files for regime processes, model and hyper-parameters should be formatted.
